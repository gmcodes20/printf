# 0x11. C - printf

## ALX  Project to be done in teams of 2 people (Godwin Martins, Joshua Ajayi)

## Tasks
### 0. I'm not going anywhere. You can print that wherever you want to. I'm here and I'm a Spur for life
     _mandatory_

Write a function that produces output according to a format.

      - Prototype: int _printf(const char *format, ...);
      - Returns: the number of characters printed (excluding the null byte used to end output to strings)
      - write output to stdout, the standard output stream
      - format is a character string. The format string is composed of zero or more directives. See man 3 printf for more detail. You need to handle the following conversion specifiers:
      	       - c
	       - s
	       - %

	- You don’t have to reproduce the buffer handling of the C library printf function
	- You don’t have to handle the flag characters
	- You don’t have to handle field width
	- You don’t have to handle precision
	- You don’t have to handle the length modifiers
