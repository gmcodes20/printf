.SH NAME
_printf - formatted output conversion
.SH SYNOPSIS
.BI "#include ''main.h''
.PP
.BI "int _printf(const char *format, ...);"
.PP
.SH DESCRIPTION
The arguments in the _printf() function produce output according to a format as described below. The function _printf() write output to stdout, the standard output stream.
.SH Format of the format string
The format string is a character string, beginning and ending in its initial shift state, if any. The format string is composed of zero or more directives: ordinary characters (not %), which are copied unchanged to the output stream; and conversion specifications, each of which results in fetching zero or more subsequent arguments. Each conversion specification is introduced by the character %, and ends with a conversion specifier.
.SH Conversion specifiers
A character that specifies the type of conversion to be applied.  The conversion specifiers and their meanings are:
.PP
.TP
.B c
.R The \fIint\fR argument is converted to an \fIunsigned char\fR, and the resulting character is written.
.TP
.B s
.R The \fIconst char *\fR argument is expected to be a pointer to an array of character type (pointer to a string). Characters from the array are written up to (but not including) a terminating null byte ('\0'), the array must contain a terminating null byte.
.TP
.B %
.R A '%' is written. No argument is converted. The complete conversion specification is '%%'.
.TP
.B d, i
.R The \fIint\fR argument is converted to signed decimal notation.
.TP
.B o, u, x, X
.R The \fIunsigned int\fR argument is converted to unsigned octal \fIo\fR (base 8 number), unsigned decimal \fIu\fR (base 10 number), unsigned hexadecimal \fIx\fR (base 16 number with lowercase letters) and unsigned hexadecimal \fIX\fR (base 16 number with uppercase letters).
.TP
.B S
.R The \fIconst char\fR argument is a pointer to an array of characters, that converts the corresponding argument to a character st\
ring, with non-printable characters (0 < ASCII value < 32 or >= 127).
.TP
.B p
.R The \fIvoid * pointer\fR argument is printed in hexadecimal.
.TP
.B S
.R The \fIconst char\fR argument is a pointer to an array
.SH The flag characters
The character \fI%\fR is followed by zero the following flags:
.TP
.B +
.R A sign \fI+\fR or \fI-\fR will be placed before a number followed by a signed conversion.
.TP
.B #
.R Print number in hexadecimal, upeercase hexadecimal and octal where the first character of the output string is made zero.
.TP
.B ' '
.R A space in blank should be left before a positive number followed by a signed conversion.
.SH NOTES
.R The \fB_printf()\fR is a project collaboration between \Joshua Ajayi\fR and \Godwin Martins\fR, actual students of Software Engineering at \fBALX\fR.
.SH RETURN VALUE
Upon successful return, these functions return the number of characters printed (excluding the null byte used to end output to strings).
.PP
If an output error is encountered, a negative value is returned.
.SH CONFORMING TO
_printf(): A function that produces output according to a format.
.SH EXAMPLES
.R To print the the string \fBHello ALX!\fR and its length in decimal.

#include ''main.h''

int main(void)

{

	int length;

	_printf(''%s'', ''Hello, ALX!'')

	_printf(''Hello ALX! contains %d characters'', length);

	length = _printf(''Hello ALX!'');

	return (0);

}
